# CodeAlpha Cyber Security Internship 

I'm currently doing a virtual internship with Code Alpha, focusing on cybersecurity. As part of my first task, I'm required to build a basic network sniffer using Python. This involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to monitor. It's an exciting opportunity for me to apply my coding skills and gain hands-on experience in cybersecurity. I'm looking forward to learning more about network protocols and enhancing my understanding of network security through this project.
